## 1. Brand Identity & Design Tokens

To ensure immediately recognizable studio branding, all apps use a consistent structural design system.

### A. Theme Colors

- **Brand Colors:** Deep Indigo (`#132F94`), Dark Slate (`#0C1D59`), and Accent/CTA Neon Amber (`#FFA500`).
- **Application UI:** Keep tab bars, popup headers, settings menus, and modals consistent across all apps using these brand colors. Content elements (e.g. wheels, quiz cards, cheesy lines lists) can use app-specific color themes.

### B. Logo Intro Stamp

- **Startup/Landing Branding:** At the bottom of welcome pages, startup splash screens (`SplashScreens.jsx`), or sign-in layouts, display:
  `● built by destyastudio.`
  Use a small, clean, monospaced font style to maintain a premium feel. Position it absolutely at the bottom of the splash page:
  ```jsx
  brandingText: {
    position: "absolute",
    bottom: 50,
    fontFamily: "monospace",
    fontSize: 10,
    color: "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4)",
    letterSpacing: 1.5,
  }
  ```

---

## 2. Web Environment Constraints & Gatekeeping

To drive native mobile app installs, Web builds are constrained as interactive promotional previews.

### A. Centered Portrait Layout (App Simulator)

- **Behavior:** On desktop monitors, the app must not stretch landscape to fill the screen. It must render inside a centered, phone-sized portrait container. On mobile browsers, it expands to normal full-screen portrait.
- **Implementation (`app/_layout.tsx`):**
  ```jsx
  {
    Platform.OS === "web" ? (
      <View
        style={{
          flex: 1,
          backgroundColor: "#0C1D59",
          justifyContent: "center",
          alignItems: "center",
        }}
      >
        <View
          style={{
            width: "100%",
            maxWidth: 480,
            height: "95%",
            maxHeight: 850,
            borderRadius: 20,
            overflow: "hidden",
            backgroundColor: "#132F94",
            shadowColor: "#000",
            shadowOpacity: 0.3,
            shadowRadius: 20,
            elevation: 10,
          }}
        >
          <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
            <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }} />
          </SafeAreaView>
        </View>
      </View>
    ) : (
      <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }} />
      </SafeAreaView>
    );
  }
  ```

### B. Web Tab Interception & Download Prompts

- **Behavior:** Users on the Web version can explore the **Home** tab freely. Clicking on other tabs (e.g. _Quiz_, _Explore_, _Profile_) blocks the navigation transition and shows a beautiful modal prompting them to download the mobile app.
- **Implementation (`app/(tabs)/_layout.jsx`):**
  ```javascript
  const webTabListener = {
    tabPress: (e) => {
      if (Platform.OS === "web") {
        e.preventDefault(); // Stop tab switch
        setIsDownloadModalVisible(true); // Open the Modal
      }
    },
  };
  ```

### C. Web Layout & Dimension Calculations (Avoiding SSR Width Crashes)

- **Constraint:** Never use `Dimensions.get("window")` or `Dimensions.get("screen")` globally at the module import level. During Web bundle/SSR generation, this evaluates to `0`, leading to negative card widths or broken grids.
- **Solution:** Compute dimensions dynamically inside the component body using the `useWindowDimensions` hook:

  ```javascript
  import { useWindowDimensions } from "react-native";

  export default function MyGridComponent() {
    const { width } = useWindowDimensions();
    const screenWidth = Math.min(width || 480, 480);
    const cardWidth = (screenWidth - padding) / columns;
    // ...
  }
  ```

---

## 3. Platform-Specific Dependency Isolation

Metro statically analyzes all imports. Native-only dependencies must be completely isolated from the Web target.

### A. Ad & Consent Manager Isolation

Use Metro's platform-specific suffix resolution to separate Web code from Native code:

- **`AdManager.js` (Native Android/iOS):** Imports `react-native-google-mobile-ads` to display Banner, Interstitial, and Rewarded ads.
- **`AdManager.web.js` (Web Preview):** A mock component exporting the same layout interfaces and hooks, returning `null` or mocked success promises.
- **`adInit.js` / `adInit.web.js`:** Separate files containing platform-isolated initialization procedures to avoid static `require()` errors on Web builds.

---

## 4. Brand Cross-Promotion & Synergy

To maximize organic traction, all apps feature standard cross-promotion hooks.

### A. The "More from Destya Studio" Hub

- **Behavior:** Add a dedicated visual card list inside the Settings or Profile screen displaying the other 4 Desty Studio apps.
- **Robust Fallback:** Hardcode the list of the other 4 apps in the component state as a local default. This guarantees the cross-promotion cards are visible even if the device is offline or the Firebase Config database fails:

  ```javascript
  const FALLBACK_APPS = [
    {
      name: "Spin the Wheel : Pick for me",
      description:
        "Spin the wheel to decide fun topics, games, meals, or challenges!",
      icon: "https://destyastudio.com/apps/spin-the-wheel/icon.png",
      androidUrl: "https://destyastudio.com/products/spin-the-wheel",
      iosUrl: "https://destyastudio.com/products/spin-the-wheel",
      isAvailableOnIOS: true,
    },
    // ... other 3 apps
  ];

  const [moreApps, setMoreApps] = useState(FALLBACK_APPS);
  ```

### B. Redirection URL Queries

- **Redirection page:** The landing page redirection script handles redirect paths based on parameters (e.g. `?app=spin-the-wheel` or `?app=cheezylines`) to direct the user to the correct app store link automatically.

### C. Gamified Cross-Promotion Rewards

- **Behavior:** Reward users in App A for trying out App B.
- **Example:** Give 2 free AI Quiz generations or +50 XP when they tap to open "Cheesy Lines" or "Spin the Wheel".
- **Tracking:** Save a local key `ds_cross_promo_[target_app_slug]_clicked` in `AsyncStorage` when redirecting, and reward them immediately upon detection.

---

## 5. Local & Push Notifications

All apps implement remote push channels for campaigns, and daily local notifications to boost user retention.

- **Libraries:** `expo-notifications`
- **Daily Engagement Prompts (Local):** Schedule recurring reminders locally so they trigger offline. Ensure these are cleared and reset upon app launch to prevent notification stacking:
  ```javascript
  await Notifications.cancelAllScheduledNotificationsAsync();
  await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
    content: {
      title: "Ready for your daily challenge?",
      body: "Unlock new AI topics and test your knowledge now!",
    },
    trigger: {
      hour: 19, // 7:00 PM
      minute: 0,
      repeats: true,
    },
  });
  ```

---

## 6. Event Analytics

To measure user retention, campaign conversions, and milestone actions, integrate custom event tracking.

- **Native Engine:** `@react-native-firebase/analytics` (Native dependency match required, e.g. matching major version numbers of `@react-native-firebase/app` using `--legacy-peer-deps`).
- **Web Engine Fallback:** Log event parameters to browser console or Google Analytics gtag.
- **Standard Events to Track:**
  - `quiz_completed` / `wheel_spun` / `line_saved`
  - `score_shared` / `invite_sent`
  - `in_app_purchase_clicked`

---

## 7. Android Target API Compliance (Android 16 / API 36+)

To ensure that Desty Studio apps remain updateable and compliant on Google Play:

- **Requirement:** Apps must target Android 16 (API level 36) or higher.
- **Constraint:** From August 31, 2026, updates will be disabled if the target API level is not within 1 year of the latest Android release.
- **Implementation:** Configure the SDK build properties in `app.json` under plugins:
  ```json
  {
    "expo": {
      "plugins": [
        [
          "expo-build-properties",
          {
            "android": {
              "targetSdkVersion": 36
            }
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
- **Action Required:** Bump target SDK, verify compiling, and release a new version to production.

---

## 8. App Store Optimization (ASO) & Store Presence

To maximize organic discoverability and increase App Store and Google Play conversions across all Desty Studio apps, adhere to the following metadata and store presence rules:

### A. Metadata Constraints & Search Terms

- **App Title:** Keep titles short and impact-driven (≤ 30 characters on both platforms) containing the brand name and one primary search term (e.g. `CodeRespite: Refresh skills` or `Trivia Quest AI: Fun Quiz`).
- **Short Description / Subtitle:** Limit to ≤ 30 characters on iOS App Store and ≤ 80 characters on Google Play Store. Highlight the unique selling proposition (USP).
- **Keyword Density:** Maintain a natural 2% to 3% keyword density in the App Store full description. Avoid keyword stuffing.

### B. Promotional Landing Pages (Web Previews)

- **Visuals:** On wide desktop screens, configure a side promotion panel adjacent to the portrait Web Simulator.
- **Content:** The panel must feature:
  - Clear app title and descriptive text detailing core features.
  - Bulleted key benefits.
  - App Store and Google Play redirection buttons (using standard links) to guide desktop visitors to mobile installations.
- **Example Layout (`app/_layout.tsx`):** Use a `flexDirection: "row"` container on Web builds that wraps to `column` on small viewport screens to present side-by-side promotional badges and mockups.

---

## 9. Deep Linking (Android App Links)

To maximize viral growth, all Destya Studio apps should support seamless deep linking.

- **Configuration (`app.json`):** Use `intentFilters` with `"autoVerify": true`.
  ```json
  "intentFilters": [
    {
      "action": "VIEW",
      "autoVerify": true,
      "data": [
        { "scheme": "https", "host": "destyastudio.com", "pathPrefix": "/spinny" }
      ],
      "category": ["BROWSABLE", "DEFAULT"]
    }
  ]
  ```
- **Verification:** Ensure `destyastudio.com/.well-known/assetlinks.json` includes the app's package name and SHA-256 fingerprint.
- **Handling in App:** Implement a `useDeepLinkHandler` hook that listens to both `Linking.getInitialURL()` (cold start) and `Linking.addEventListener('url')` (foreground) to extract URL parameters and update the app state.

---

## 10. In-App Update System (GitHub Hosted)

To bypass store review times and ensure users update to the latest features, use a GitHub-hosted update checker.

- **Remote Manifest:** Host a `version.json` file in the GitHub repo root containing `latestVersion` and a `whatsNew` array.
- **Update Hook:** Create a `useUpdateChecker.js` hook that fetches the raw `version.json` on app cold start (using `cache: 'no-store'`).
- **Trigger:** If the remote version is greater than `Constants.expoConfig.version`, display an `UpdateModal` showing what's new. Use `AsyncStorage` to ensure the modal only shows once per JS session.

---

## 11. Groq AI Integration (Free & Unlimited)

Instead of relying on costly backend OpenAI services, utilize Groq Cloud API directly on the client for instant generation.

- **Model Selection:** Default to `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` via `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions` for extreme speed.
- **In-App API Key Configuration:** Since the apps are free, include a setup guide asking users to enter their own Groq API key for unlimited generations. Save this key securely in `AsyncStorage`.
- **Fallback Engine:** Always provide hardcoded JSON templates as offline fallbacks so the feature functions smoothly even without an internet connection or an API key.

---

## 12. App Store & Google Play AI Compliance Policies

To prevent app rejections under Apple's User Generated Content (UGC) safety policies (Guideline 1.2) and Google Play's Generative AI requirements, all AI-enabled features must implement the following safeguards:

### A. Safety Prompts & Input Moderation
- **Rule:** Configure the system prompt to explicitly reject inappropriate, harmful, sexual, hateful, or violent user inputs.
- **Implementation:** Instruct the LLM to output a standardized error format (e.g. `[{"error": "Inappropriate topic..."}]`) if it detects violation, and handle it gracefully in the UI.

### B. AI Content Disclaimers
- **Rule:** Display a visible warning label near all AI-generated content blocks to alert users about model hallucinations.
- **Sample Text:** `"⚠️ AI responses are generated dynamically and may contain errors. Please verify critical facts."`

### C. Output Reporting & Flagging
- **Rule:** Provide an immediate mechanism for users to report or flag offensive/incorrect AI output.
- **Implementation:** Add a "Report output" button or flag icon adjacent to AI responses that registers a flag event and notifies the user.

---

## 13. Ad Placement & Monetization Strategy

To balance effective monetization with a premium user experience, follow these structural guidelines for integrating `react-native-google-mobile-ads` across all Desty Studio apps:

### A. Local Ad Configuration (`adConfig`)
- **Rule:** While Ad Unit IDs can be stored in `.env` or remote configs, the runtime configuration and user's "Ad-Free" status must be managed locally via a React Context (e.g., `adFreeContext`).
- **Implementation:** Create a provider (`WheelsContextProvider` or `AdProvider`) that wraps the app. It should check `AsyncStorage` on mount to see if an ad-free reward is currently active (e.g., comparing `ad_free_until` timestamp to `Date.now()`). If the user is premium or rewarded, `adFreeContext` provides `isAdFree: true` globally, instantly disabling all ad components.

### B. Rewarded Video Ads (Contextual Hook & Consent)
- **Effectiveness:** Best for unlocking premium features (like 1-hour ad-free sessions or AI credits) without forcing paid subscriptions.
- **Implementation:** Create a custom hook like `useRewardedAdLoader` that preloads the video ad on component mount. Provide its state globally via `rewardedAdContext`.
- **Mandatory User Consent:** NEVER play a rewarded ad immediately upon tapping a button. You MUST show a confirmation dialog (e.g., a native `Alert` or a custom themed `WebModal`) explicitly explaining *why* they need to watch the ad and giving them the option to cancel.
- **Usage:**
  ```javascript
  const { isRewardedAdLoaded, showRewardedAd } = useContext(rewardedAdContext);
  // Example implementation on button press
  const handlePress = () => {
    Alert.alert(
      "Watch an Ad",
      "Would you like to watch a short video ad to earn 3 AI Credits?",
      [
        { text: "No Thanks", style: "cancel" },
        { text: "Watch Ad", onPress: () => showRewardedAd() }
      ]
    );
  };
  ```
- **Post-Reward Handling:** Once the user finishes watching, the hook's `onAdEarnedReward` listener should update `AsyncStorage` (e.g., set `ad_free_until` to `Date.now() + 1 * 60 * 60 * 1000` for 1 hour) and update the context state so the UI instantly updates.

### C. Native Advanced Ads
- **Effectiveness:** Native Ads are the highest performing format because they blend seamlessly into the app's UI.
- **Placement:** Insert Native Ads into vertical scrolling feeds, grids, or directly below primary content blocks. Use a wrapper component (e.g., `NativeAdComponent`) that conditionally renders only if `!isAdFree`.
- **Styling:** Style the native ad container to match the padding, border radius, and shadow of adjacent standard UI cards. Ensure it includes the mandatory "Ad" attribution badge.
- **Implementation:** 
  ```javascript
  import { NativeAdComponent } from './services/AdManager';
  
  // Inside a feed or modal:
  {!isAdFree && (
    <View style={styles.adContainer}>
       <NativeAdComponent />
    </View>
  )}
  ```

### D. Interstitial & App Open Ads
- **Effectiveness:** High CPM, but can be highly disruptive.
- **App Open Placement:** Trigger App Open ads *only* during cold starts or when the app is resumed from the background after a significant delay (e.g., > 1 hour), never on brief multitasking swaps. Ensure they immediately abort if `isAdFree` is true.
- **Interstitial Placement:** Trigger these *only* at natural transition points (e.g. completing a level, spinning the wheel 3 times). Avoid showing them back-to-back.

### E. Ad Layout & Spacing
- **Constraint:** Ad components (Native and Banner) must only occupy screen space if they successfully load and the user is NOT ad-free.
- **Implementation:** Track the ad loading state and apply styling conditionally so the container returns `null` or has `height: 0` until the ad successfully loads, ensuring no empty padding remains visible.

---

## 14. Purposeful AI Integration

AI features (via Groq/Llama) should enhance the app experience, not overwhelm it. Avoid "AI for the sake of AI".

### A. When to Use AI
- **Generative Content Extension:** Use AI to generate infinite variations of core content (e.g., custom quizzes, personalized learning roadmaps, dynamic trivia questions).
- **Interactive Assistance:** Use AI as a contextual helper (e.g., a "Tutor" chatbot, explanation generator for incorrect answers).

### B. When to Avoid AI
- **Core Navigation:** Do not replace standard UI navigation with a conversational interface if buttons are faster.
- **Static Content:** Do not use AI to generate static text that could easily be hardcoded or retrieved from a database (e.g., privacy policies, standard app instructions).

### C. UI Integration
- **Opt-In Experience:** AI generation can be unpredictable. Make AI features distinct and opt-in. Keep standard, deterministic content available by default.
- **Visual Separation:** Clearly delineate AI-generated content (e.g., using a subtle gradient background or a "Sparkles" icon) so users understand it was dynamically created.

---

## 15. In-App Review & ASO Optimization

To organically boost ASO rankings across Desty Studio apps, rely on the native `expo-store-review` package rather than expecting users to manually visit the App Store.

### A. The Core Principle: Ask at Peak Satisfaction
- **Rule:** Never interrupt a user's flow to ask for a review randomly.
- **Implementation:** Trigger the review prompt immediately *after* a high-dopamine event, such as:
  - Closing a "Level Up" modal.
  - Getting a 100% perfect score on a quiz.
  - Earning a rare badge or achievement.

### B. How to Integrate
1. **Install:** Run `npx expo install expo-store-review`.
2. **Safe Triggering:** Native review modules crash in standard Expo Go or unsupported environments if not handled safely. Always wrap the trigger in a safe async block.
3. **Anti-Spam Checks:** Use `AsyncStorage` to ensure you only ask the user once per milestone (e.g. they shouldn't be asked every time they get a perfect score).

### C. Standard Boilerplate Logic
Use this template for triggering a review safely:
```javascript
import * as StoreReview from "expo-store-review";
import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";

const triggerStoreReview = async (storageKey = "hasPromptedReview") => {
  try {
    const hasPrompted = await AsyncStorage.getItem(storageKey);
    // 1. Check if we haven't spammed them
    // 2. Safely check if the native Action exists (prevents Expo Go crashes)
    if (!hasPrompted && await StoreReview.hasAction()) {
      await StoreReview.requestReview();
      await AsyncStorage.setItem(storageKey, "true");
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("[StoreReview] Failed to trigger:", err);
  }
};
```
*Note: The native UI will only appear in a production build or Custom Dev Client, but `StoreReview.hasAction()` ensures development environments degrade gracefully.*

---

## 16. Data Refresh & State Management

To ensure users always have access to the latest content (e.g., dynamically updated Firebase configurations, new questions, or fresh courses) without needing to restart the app:

### A. Pull-to-Refresh Implementation
- **Behavior:** Implement standard "Pull-to-Refresh" functionality using React Native's `RefreshControl` component on all main scrollable screens (like `FlatList` or `ScrollView`).
- **Data Sync:** When triggered, the `onRefresh` handler must explicitly re-fetch remote data (such as querying Firestore or fetching a remote JSON manifest) and update the local context or state immediately.
- **Platform Constraint:** Note that native pull-to-refresh physics and interactions are strictly designed for **Native Mobile environments (iOS and Android)**. On the Web version, this gesture is typically not supported natively by browsers, so web builds will rely on normal component mounting logic or manual reload buttons. Ensure the `RefreshControl` is implemented but understand it will primarily act as a mobile-exclusive feature.

---

## 17. Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates via EAS Update

For rapid deployment of JavaScript and asset changes without requiring users to download a new binary from the App Store or Google Play, all Desty Studio apps use **EAS Update**.

### A. How it Works
- **Mechanism:** Expo Application Services (EAS) hosts your new JavaScript bundle. When users open the app, the `expo-updates` client checks for a new version, downloads it in the background, and applies it upon the next cold start.
- **Constraints:** You can *only* use EAS Update for changes to JavaScript (React components, hooks, styles) and local assets (images, fonts). If you add new native modules (like a new package requiring `pod install` or Android build changes), you **must** build a new binary and submit it to the stores.
- **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** You must explicitly define the `"channel"` property for every build profile in `eas.json` (e.g., `"channel": "production"` under the production profile). If this is missing when you build the `.aab`/`.apk`, the native app will NOT be linked to a channel and will permanently be incapable of receiving OTA updates.

### B. Publishing an EAS Update
1. Test your app thoroughly using a local build (`npx expo start -c`).
2. Run the update command in your terminal targeting the specific branch (usually `production` or `preview`):
   ```bash
   eas update --branch production --message "Describe your fixes or features"
   ```
3. The CLI will bundle the app and upload it. The update is instantly available to any user on that branch.

### C. Combining with GitHub Hosted Checker
If you make a native change requiring a store update, do NOT use EAS Update. Instead, bump the `"version"` in `app.config.js`, update the remote `version.json` (as described in Section 10), and submit a new binary to the stores. The custom modal will then prompt users to manually update their app.

---

## 18. High-Performance Storage (SecureStore)

To ensure the fastest possible synchronous read/writes and secure storage of sensitive keys, we utilize Expo Secure Store.


### B. Expo Secure Store
- **Usage:** Use `expo-secure-store` exclusively for sensitive credentials (e.g., Groq API Keys, Authentication Tokens).
- **Security:** This ensures data is encrypted and stored in the iOS Keychain or Android Keystore, preventing unauthorized access on rooted/jailbroken devices.

---

## 19. High-Performance Lists (FlashList)

To guarantee smooth 60fps/120fps scrolling on both high-end and low-end devices, avoid using React Native's standard `FlatList` for long data arrays.

- **Library:** `@shopify/flash-list`
- **Implementation:** Replace `<FlatList>` with `<FlashList>`.
- **Requirement:** You **must** provide an accurate `estimatedItemSize` prop to `FlashList` to ensure the native view recycling engine calculates layout bounds correctly before rendering.

---

## 20. Advanced UI Animations (Reanimated)

React Native's legacy `Animated` API runs on the JS thread by default (unless `useNativeDriver: true` is provided, which is limited). To unlock complex, buttery-smooth animations that run entirely on the UI thread, we use React Native Reanimated.

- **Library:** `react-native-reanimated` (v3+)
- **Concepts:** Replace `Animated.Value` with `useSharedValue()`. Replace standard inline styles with `useAnimatedStyle()`. Use `withSpring()` and `withTiming()` worklets to drive the shared values.
- **Performance:** This eliminates JS thread bottlenecks during heavy renders, ensuring UI animations (like card flips, swipes, and pop-ins) remain fluid.

---

## 21. Server State & Cache Management (React Query)

Avoid using scattered `useState` and `useEffect` hooks combined with manual `AsyncStorage` cache checks for remote data fetching.

- **Library:** `@tanstack/react-query`
- **Implementation:** Wrap the application in a `<QueryClientProvider>`. Replace custom fetch logic with the `useQuery` hook.
- **Benefits:** React Query automatically handles caching, deduping simultaneous requests, background refetching on window focus, and stale-time management, drastically reducing boilerplate code and race conditions.

---

## 22. Crash Reporting & Observability (Sentry)

To gain full visibility into production crashes, unhandled promise rejections, and performance bottlenecks, we integrate Sentry.

- **Library:** `@sentry/react-native`
- **Implementation:** Initialize Sentry at the very top of the app's entry point (`app/_layout.tsx`) using `Sentry.init()`. Wrap the root component in `Sentry.wrap()`.
  - **Action:** Ensure the Expo plugin `@sentry/react-native/expo` is added to `app.config.js` to automatically upload source maps during the EAS build process.

---

## 23. In-App Purchases (IAP) & Premium Unlocks

To manage permanent premium upgrades (like "Remove All Ads") or consumable item packs across Desty Studio apps, follow this production-tested, offline-safe purchasing architecture using `react-native-iap`.

---

### A. Google Play Billing Library Requirement & Package Selection

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Google Play Billing Library v8.0.0+ Mandatory Requirement**
> All apps published to Google Play must use **Google Play Billing Library version 8.0.0 or later** (required by Google Play Console policy).

- **Recommended Version:** Use **`react-native-iap@14.4.0`** with matching peer dependency **`react-native-nitro-modules@0.29.6`**.
- **Play Billing Version:** `react-native-iap@14.4.0` includes `openiap-google:1.2.6` which natively compiles against **Google Play Billing Library v8.0.0** (`com.android.billingclient:billing:8.0.0` / `billing-ktx:8.0.0`).
- **Nitro Modules Dependency Pinning:** Ensure `"react-native-nitro-modules": "^0.29.6"` is explicitly defined in `package.json`. Version `0.30.0+` introduces template trait mismatches in generated `JHybridRnIapSpec.hpp` (`no member named 'CxxBase' in 'facebook::jni::detail::HybridTraits'`). Pinning `0.29.6` ensures 100% clean C++ compilation across all ABIs (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86`, `x86_64`).

### B. Android Build Properties & Memory Configuration

1. **Google Play Billing SDK Version:**
   `react-native-iap@14.4.0` automatically resolves `com.android.billingclient:billing:8.0.0`.
   *Note: Do NOT manually set legacy `playBillingSdkVersion = "7.0.0"` in Gradle build files.*

2. **Gradle JVM Memory (`android/gradle.properties`):**
   R8 code minification and ProGuard shrinking for apps with IAP, Nitro Modules, and Google Mobile Ads require at least 4 GB of Java Heap. Set:
   ```properties
   org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1024m
   ```
3. **Release Lint Safeguard (`android/app/build.gradle`):**
   Disable redundant release lint checks inside the `android { ... }` block to prevent Out-Of-Memory crashes during release packaging:
   ```groovy
   android {
       lintOptions {
           checkReleaseBuilds false
           abortOnError false
       }
   }
   ```
4. **Clean Dependencies:** Ensure no conflicting legacy v12 dependencies exist in `package.json`.

### C. The 3-Layer Offline Robustness Strategy

Because users frequently open apps offline or under poor network conditions, IAP status cannot rely strictly on active network calls:

1. **Layer 1 (Local Storage Sync):**
   - Upon a successful purchase listener callback (`purchaseUpdatedListener`), immediately call `AsyncStorage.setItem('isPremium', 'true')` (or `ad_free_until` timestamp).
   - On app startup, your global `AdContext` or `IAPContext` MUST read directly from `AsyncStorage` first so the user stays premium even completely offline.
2. **Layer 2 (Localized Price Fallback UI):**
   - Dynamically render price strings from fetched product metadata: `{products?.[0]?.localizedPrice || '$2.99'}`.
   - If the network fails to fetch Google/Apple billing products, the UI gracefully displays the hardcoded default fallback instead of breaking layout.
3. **Layer 3 (Pre-Purchase Network Guard):**
   - Before invoking `RNIap.requestPurchase()`, verify `if (!products || products.length === 0)`.
   - If products are unavailable (offline/unconnected), present a clear user `Alert` ("Please connect to the internet to make a purchase") rather than letting the native billing modal throw an uncaught exception.

### D. Mandatory "Restore Purchases" Flow

Apple App Store Guideline 3.1.1 and Google Play Billing policy require a visible mechanism to restore non-consumable purchases.

- **Placement:** Place a prominent "Restore Purchases" button in the Settings / Premium modal.
- **Logic:**
  ```javascript
  const handleRestorePurchases = async () => {
    try {
      const purchases = await RNIap.getAvailablePurchases();
      const hasPurchasedPremium = purchases.some(
        (p) => p.productId === "your_premium_sku"
      );

      if (hasPurchasedPremium) {
        await AsyncStorage.setItem("isPremium", "true");
        setIsPremium(true);
        Alert.alert("Success", "Your premium purchase has been restored!");
      } else {
        Alert.alert("No Purchases Found", "No active purchases were found for your account.");
      }
    } catch (err) {
      Alert.alert("Error", "Could not restore purchases. Please try again later.");
    }
  };
  ```

### E. Quick Integration Checklist for New Apps

1. Install Google Play Billing 8.0.0+ compliant stack: `npm i react-native-iap@14.4.0 react-native-nitro-modules@0.29.6`
2. Update `android/gradle.properties` with `-Xmx4096m` heap.
3. Add `lintOptions { checkReleaseBuilds false; abortOnError false }` to `android/app/build.gradle`.
4. Wrap the application root with `IAPProvider` & `AdContextProvider`.
5. Verify release APK build locally via `./gradlew assembleRelease`.

## 24. Multi-Language Support (i18n) & Dynamic Content Localization

To scale Desty Studio apps across international markets (US/UK, India, Indonesia, Spain/LATAM, Brazil, Germany, France), implement this standard i18n architecture.

### A. Package Selection & Installation
```bash
npx expo install expo-localization
npm install i18next react-i18next
```

### B. OTA-Compatible Engine Setup (`i18n/index.ts`)
Wrap `expo-localization` calls in a `try-catch` block so OTA updates delivered via EAS Update never crash older binaries that lack native C++/Java bindings.

```typescript
import i18n from 'i18next';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import * as Localization from 'expo-localization';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

import en from './locales/en.json';
import id from './locales/id.json';
import es from './locales/es.json';
import pt from './locales/pt.json';
import de from './locales/de.json';
import fr from './locales/fr.json';
import hi from './locales/hi.json';

const LANGUAGE_KEY = 'user_selected_language';
const resources = { en: { translation: en }, id: { translation: id }, es: { translation: es }, pt: { translation: pt }, de: { translation: de }, fr: { translation: fr }, hi: { translation: hi } };

const getInitialLanguage = async (): Promise<string> => {
  try {
    const saved = await AsyncStorage.getItem(LANGUAGE_KEY);
    if (saved && resources[saved as keyof typeof resources]) return saved;
  } catch (e) {}

  let deviceLocale = 'en';
  try {
    const primary = Localization.getLocales()?.[0];
    const langCode = primary?.languageCode || 'en';
    const regionCode = (primary?.regionCode || '').toUpperCase();

    // Indian region defaults strictly to English ('en')
    if (regionCode === 'IN') {
      deviceLocale = 'en';
    } else if (resources[langCode as keyof typeof resources]) {
      deviceLocale = langCode;
    }
  } catch (e) {}

  return resources[deviceLocale as keyof typeof resources] ? deviceLocale : 'en';
};

export const initI18n = async () => {
  const initialLanguage = await getInitialLanguage();
  if (!i18n.isInitialized) {
    await i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
      resources,
      lng: initialLanguage,
      fallbackLng: 'en',
      interpolation: { escapeValue: false },
    });
  }
};

export const changeLanguage = async (langCode: string) => {
  await AsyncStorage.setItem(LANGUAGE_KEY, langCode);
  await i18n.changeLanguage(langCode);
};

export default i18n;
```

### C. App-Wide Real-Time Reactivity (`app/_layout.tsx`)
Wrap the entire root tree in `<I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>` so language switches in Settings update 100% of screens in real time without restarting the app:

```tsx
import i18n, { initI18n } from '../i18n';
import { I18nextProvider } from 'react-i18next';

export default function RootLayout() {
  useEffect(() => { initI18n(); }, []);

  return (
    <I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>
      <SafeAreaProvider>
        <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }} />
      </SafeAreaProvider>
    </I18nextProvider>
  );
}
```

### D. Region-Aware Language Picker (`app/settings.tsx`)
Filter language choices dynamically based on user region (e.g. English + Hinglish for India, English + Bahasa Indonesia for Indonesia) and include a toggle to view all supported languages:

```tsx
const getRelevantLanguages = () => {
  if (showAllLangs) return LANGUAGES;
  try {
    const primary = Localization.getLocales()?.[0];
    const regionCode = (primary?.regionCode || '').toUpperCase();
    const langCode = primary?.languageCode || 'en';

    if (regionCode === 'IN') return LANGUAGES.filter(l => l.code === 'en' || l.code === 'hi');
    if (regionCode === 'ID' || langCode === 'id') return LANGUAGES.filter(l => l.code === 'en' || l.code === 'id');
    if (['ES', 'MX', 'AR'].includes(regionCode) || langCode === 'es') return LANGUAGES.filter(l => l.code === 'en' || l.code === 'es');
    if (regionCode === 'BR' || langCode === 'pt') return LANGUAGES.filter(l => l.code === 'en' || l.code === 'pt');
    if (['DE', 'AT', 'CH'].includes(regionCode) || langCode === 'de') return LANGUAGES.filter(l => l.code === 'en' || l.code === 'de');
    if (['FR', 'CA'].includes(regionCode) || langCode === 'fr') return LANGUAGES.filter(l => l.code === 'en' || l.code === 'fr');
  } catch (e) {}
  return LANGUAGES;
};
```

### E. Dynamic Content Localization Engine (Data Layer)
Across all Desty Studio apps (quizzes, icebreaker questions, cheesy lines, trivia cards, wheels), core content data should be kept clean in master English format inside asset JSON files. To localize content without polluting `i18n/locales/*.json` (which is strictly for UI strings like buttons, labels, and titles), create a `CONTENT_TRANSLATIONS` mapping dictionary inside your data layer (`Constants.js` or `data/contentLocalization.js`) and import the active `i18n` singleton directly:

```javascript
// Generic Data-Layer Localization Pattern
import app_master_content from "../../assets/app_content.json";
import i18n from "../../i18n";

const CONTENT_TRANSLATIONS = {
  id: {
    // Content titles, categories, questions, or option items
    "What to eat?": "Mau makan apa?",
    "Truth or Dare": "Jujur atau Tantangan",
    "Fried Rice": "Nasi Goreng 🍚"
  },
  hi: { /* Hinglish mappings */ },
  es: { /* Spanish mappings */ },
  pt: { /* Portuguese mappings */ },
  de: { /* German mappings */ },
  fr: { /* French mappings */ }
};

export function getLocalizedContent(tOrLang) {
  const contentToUse = app_master_content;
  let lang = i18n.language || 'en';
  if (typeof tOrLang === 'string') {
    lang = tOrLang;
  } else if (tOrLang?.language) {
    lang = tOrLang.language;
  } else if (tOrLang?.i18n?.language) {
    lang = tOrLang.i18n.language;
  }

  const dict = CONTENT_TRANSLATIONS[lang] || {};

  return contentToUse.map((item) => {
    const localizedTitle = dict[item.name || item.title] || item.name || item.title;
    const localizedItems = (item.items || item.segments || item.options || []).map((subItem) => ({
      ...subItem,
      name: dict[subItem.name || subItem.text] || subItem.name || subItem.text
    }));
    return {
      ...item,
      name: localizedTitle,
      items: localizedItems
    };
  });
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Avoid passing translation function `t` directly for language detection**: React `useTranslation()`'s `t` function is a plain function and does NOT carry `t.i18n.language`. Always import the `i18n` singleton directly (`import i18n from '../../i18n'`) inside your data layer so `i18n.language` immediately evaluates to the user's active language choice!

### F. AI Generator Prompt Injection
Inject the user's active language into the Groq AI system prompt so AI features dynamically generate responses in the active UI language:

```typescript
const activeLangName = getLanguageName(i18n.language); // e.g. "Bahasa Indonesia"
const systemPrompt = `You are an AI generator. Return JSON ONLY in ${activeLangName}...`;
```
